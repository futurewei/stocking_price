# stocking_price

Previously, I did a stock predictor with machine learning and NLTK involved, which achieved a 60% accuracy. 60% accuracy is really not very good for investment. To better help me visualize the stock market and make decisions, I decided to make this stock visualizer that merely involves some matplotlib and dataframe.
While the project is pretty simple, it does look pretty informational.
